# Pok√©mon Data Analysis in PCA Space

This repository contains the code for the interactive app of an in-depth analysis on Pok√©mon data in PCA space. I highly encourage you to check out the app, as it is much more fun to explore the data interactively than to read through the code. The app is built using Streamlit and Plotly, and it allows you to visualize Pok√©mon stats and types in 2D and 3D using PCA and other techniques.

You can explore the app and check out the full analysis here:

## Introduction
Visualizing data in a graphical way often helps to understand the data better, however, this is not easy to do when dealing with high dimensional data. I wanted to put this into practice and thought that it would be a good idea to use data I am already familiar with, given that I should be able to tell when a result is wrong or unexpected. This is how I ended up with a needlessly complex (but fun) analysis on Pok√©mon stats and types. Are there type combinations yet to be explored? Could they be classified in large groups? Do Pok√©mon stats correlate with their types? Could we use this information to build a better team? I will try to answer these questions in this project.

## Try it out!
